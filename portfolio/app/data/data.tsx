	body: "A software engineer with a passion for solving problems with code. I started my journey into the world of software development after I had to close my yoga studio due to the pandemic.  Since then I've been constantly learning and practicing algorithms as I love how they're reshaping my brain to find the smaller picture as opposed to the big picture. I'm always looking for opportunities to explore new technologies as tech is always changing.",
	highlightedBody:
		"Before I moved into enginneering, I was a line cook and worked in the kitchens in New York City. Over time I worked my way up to lead line cook, then eventually sous chef.  If there's one skill I see in alignment with tech, it's working with a team requires strong communication skills.  I'm constantly seeking new challenges and projects to work on. I've competed in a few hackathons along the way and am proud to say I've been awarded 'Best Accessibility Hack' by MLH for their climate hack weekend. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with others, and I believe that working on projects is the best way to learn and grow as a software engineer.",
	body2:
		"When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, testing recipes. praticing yoga as I believe the mind and body are always ready to learn new things. I believe if it doesn't challenge you or scare you, it doesn't change you. I'm a lifelong learner, and I'm always looking for courses to help me improve my skills and knowledge. If you're interested in learning more about my skills and experience, feel free to take a look at my CV. I'd love to hear from you and discuss potential opportunities to collaborate on projects or learn from each other.",
